### Introduction

The purpose of this assignment is to demonstrate your ability to write a short news story based on your analysis of a dataset, and to then identify human sources who could later strengthen that story. You may work with *up to three classmates* on this assignment---if you do so, please note your classmates in the `author` part of your R Notebook header (e.g., `author: "Rodrigo Zamith (with Bukayo Saka, Kieran Tierney, and Emile Smith Rowe)"`).

You will be submitting an R Notebook (**both** the `.Rmd` and `.html` files) that answers the questions at the bottom of this page.

### The Data

The primary dataset you will be working with includes [Paycheck Protection Program loan data](https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/cares-act/assistance-for-small-businesses/sba-paycheck-protection-program-loan-level-data) covering all loans up until August 8, 2020. If you are unfamiliar with the PPP, [Wikipedia might help](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paycheck_Protection_Program). [This short document](https://www.sba.gov/sites/default/files/2020-08/PPP%20Loan%20Data%20-%20Key%20Aspects%2008212020-508.pdf) from the Small Business Administration also includes useful context for these data.

The full dataset published by the U.S. Department of the Treasury covers all 50 states, but to keep the file size manageable, _I have only included data for Massachusetts_. Additionally, the Department of the Treasury splits these data into two separate datasets: one for loans under $150,000 (which includes an exact amount, which you can find under `LoanAmount`) and one for loans above $150,000 (which only includes a general range, which you can find under `LoanRange`). The CSV file you will be using for this assignment is a combination of those two datasets, with some additional clean-up work to save you time.

You will also be working with two additional datasets. The first is a translation dataset that maps [North American Industry Classification System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_American_Industry_Classification_System) codes into industry names, which would make it easier for you to examine the distribution of loans by industry. The second is a translation dataset that helps standardize some of the sloppy city names by adding a new variable (`CityStandardized`). I quickly performed this clean-up effort myself, and it may still have some mistakes---but it is certainly in better shape than the original SBA data, which simply relied on the applicants' mistake-riddled input.

You are welcome to combine these data with any other dataset that may prove useful to you.

### Your Objective

Please answer the following questions through an R Notebook (please use [this template file](https://zamith.umasscreate.net/data/exercise_3_yourname.Rmd)):

1. Combine the `ppp_ma` data frame with the `naics_codes` and `city_standardized` data frame, so we have information about the different industries that received the loans and less-messy city names.

&nbsp;

2. You have entered a time machine that takes you back to August 10, 2020. Your editor at the [_Daily Hampshire Gazette_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Hampshire_Gazette) has asked you to write a short story _about the Paycheck Protection Program and how the money has been distributed_. Take a look at this dataset and come up with **five** interview questions **for these data**. Be sure to write out each question (try to orient the phrasing around quantifiable things that you can observe in the dataset), then use R to answer the question, and provide a clear answer to your own question.
    - Remember who your audience is here, as well as the context around that time period. Questions were being raised about who was getting money, whether it was being thoughtfully distributed, if the amounts were sufficient (or excessive), etc.

&nbsp;

3. Your editor has tasked you to write a **300-400 word news story** that incorporates your findings. You've been given full editorial autonomy for the subject of the story and how to approach it. "You've been doing the digging, so you know the story best," the editor said.
    - We have not yet covered newswriting yet, so I will not be grading the quality of **newswriting** too closely, though I expect the story to be grammatically sound. However, here are some tips to consider at this stage:
        - The lede, or introduction to the story, is typically no longer than a couple of sentences. It should either summarize the main points of the story or suck a reader in with a striking finding or anecdote. Don't write a novel, though.
        - Paragraphs in news stories are rarely longer than four sentences. In fact, many are just two sentences long. News stories tend to have a fast pace to them and are designed to be easy to read. (Long paragraphs are imposing. Source: Your assignments.)
        - Sentences are typically short and simple. Take creative liberty when you have mastered the basics of a subject-verb-object formula (e.g., "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced new social distancing guidelines on Monday."). Succinct writing is best.
        - Use simple language. You want your work to be accessible. Simplify any terms of art and assume your reader has a high school reading comprehension level.
        - Avoid the first-person for this story. Similarly, please do not write, "I decided to analyze the data to see what the infection rate was." Instead, just get to the answer: "According to data from the CDC, Florida's infection rate was ... ." Remember that this is a story, not a lab report.
        - Source all claims/assertions in your story. Where did the information come from?
        - Do not repeat information, or summarize the story at the end by repeating what has been written above it. Find a conclusion that helps to advance the story.
        - You do not have to include every finding in your story. Focus on the most interesting stuff. Sometimes, less is more.

&nbsp;

4. Identify **two** interviewees who can add some expertise to this story. Recall that there are different forms of expertise, and the purpose of these individuals is to help contextualize the story and add a different layer to the analysis you have performed. For **each** interviewee, please provide the following information:
    - Their name, title/position, and the main (or most relevant) organization they work for
    - Their contact information (e.g., a work phone number or e-mail address)
    - The URL to some page that has details about them (e.g., biography page, personal website). If the source does not have a URL, please provide a short description that would help your editor ascertain their appropriateness for this piece.
    - A couple of sentences that details what you think they could add to your article. Please **be specific**. For example, maybe they've done some research that could help explain a specific finding you from your analysis, or they have some specific lived experience that would help contextualize the reporting.
    - Your **three** most important interview questions for **that human source**. Assume that you are conducting the interview over the phone, and that you've already established a rapport with them. Be sure to phrase your questions in a thoughtful way, per the advice from the lesson materials.
