### Introduction

Today, you will be demonstrating your ability to produce a well-formatted [R Notebook](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/notebook.html) using [Markdown](https://www.markdowntutorial.com/).

Specifically, you will need to create an exact replica (except for the two areas where I ask you to insert your name and ideas about an interesting story topic) of [this R Notebook](r_notebook.html).

When you are done creating your replica, please submit your Notebook using [this Google Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc_BABF5WNZxNAR0C5QaI-GKMBiEX1jdtAzzVzXRadQ0ujRJw/viewform).

As a reminder, you can also access a Markdown tip sheet by loading RStudio, going to **Help**, and selecting **Markdown Quick Reference**.
